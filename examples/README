OpenID Example Code
-------------------

To try the example consumer implementation (which is probably what you
want), just copy the consumer/ directory into a place on your web
server and point your browser at the new directory.  (Be sure that the
'Auth' directory included in this package is installed in your PHP
include_path.)

The 'index.php' file will render a form and get you started.  These
are the example consumer files:

  consumer/index.php - Renders a form so you can begin the OpenID auth
process.  The form submits the OpenID to try_auth.php.

  consumer/try_auth.php - Starts the authentication with the OpenID
server that manages your OpenID and redirects your browser to the
server's login page.  Instructs the server to return to
finish_auth.php when you're done authenticating.

  consumer/finish_auth.php - Finishes the authentication by checking
the server's response.  Tells you if the authentication was
successful.

  consumer/common.php - Includes the setup code you'll need to create
a Consumer object and participate in an OpenID authentication.
